2. What if Wade decided to join IOI, what would happened with his quest of the treasure? would he ended up leading the world?
IOI will use Wade to find the three keys to getting Easter eggs hidden by Halliday somewhere. If Wade wins, then all stock of The Oasis will be owned by IOI and Wade will get other rewards.

3. What kind of "Game Element" you suggest to make the movie more interesting? explain why.
This film tend to show players difficulty in solving hidden clues at each level. But the challenges they have to face look too easy to pass. In my opinion, for a game as complex as this the challenge must be made a little more difficult to make it look more attractive and the audience becomes more tense.
